        <p>Currently a Communication & Multimedia Design student at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. Based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.</p>
        
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Sharlainie</strong> — a 21-year-old second-year student at the <em>Hogeschool van Amsterdam</em>, studying <em>Communication & Multimedia Design</em>. Living in Amsterdam, I’m inspired by everyday visuals and moments — and I love turning that inspiration into purposeful, user-centered design.</p>
        
        <p>Design is more than just my studies — it's something I’m genuinely passionate about, and I enjoy exploring how creativity and functionality come together. Whether I’m wireframing a new interface, creating social content, or helping my sister with her business branding and social media strategy, I find fulfillment in every project I take on. I also love experimenting with different design forms, such as video, photography, and motion graphics, to enhance my creative skill set and bring fresh perspectives to my work.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of design, I enjoy experimenting with making little vlogs for YouTube, discovering new cafés, going for walks, and staying curious about trends in visual storytelling and user experience.</p>
        
        <p>I’m always building my skills — from UI/UX design and front-end development to content creation and digital branding. My goal is to grow into a designer who not only crafts beautiful visuals but creates purposeful, human-centered digital experiences.</p>
